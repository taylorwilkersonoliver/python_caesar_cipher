Simple Caesar Cipher to encrypt and decrypt text. 

     A caesar cipher is a very basic form of encryption.  In today's world of modern encryption methods this cipher seems more like simple obfuscation but technically, yes, it is encryption. Understanding how and why this works is an important building block towards more complicated ciphers.  The caesar cipher is also known as the 'shift' cipher because of the literal shift in the indexing of characters for an alphabet  For example, the ASCII ordinal for the character "A" is the integer 65.  To implement a shift cipher, we add or subtract from that integer.  If the shift is +10, 65 becomes 75 which is the ASCII ordinal for the letter "K". A shift cipher can be very useful if implemented with openly available data like numbers from sports scores, temperatures for certain regions or geographic coordinates, and even times or dates.  For our purposes here today we will use the ASCII character index as our alphabet and a shift of only 5.  Like a combination lock, a caesar cipher can be stacked in different directions by adding or subtracting different shifts.
